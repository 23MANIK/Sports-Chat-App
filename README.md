## About The Project

 <img src="images/logo2.png" alt="Logo" width="80%">
 <br/>
 I created this project for my implementation of web development knowledge to create a real-time chat application.<br/>
 In this application, we can chat with our friends by choosing the same team name by entering their name and choosing their team. 
 
 ## Features

-   Join a specified team room to chat
    
-   You can see who is online at that time on your left
    
-   Automatically scroll down upon receiving a new message
    
-   You can leave a meating and join other just by clicking leave button

-   The chat will be stored

 
 
<!--   The chat messages also show who and when somebody msg in the team room.
  If the messages overloaded in chat box than it will automatically scroll down to bottom and you can scroll up to see previous messages also.
  In left side of window you can see you team name and name of people online in team room at that time.
  There is also a leave button from where you can go on first page of Chat app and can join different team room. -->
