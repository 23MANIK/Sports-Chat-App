  I created this project for my implementaion of web Developement knowledge to create a real time chat application.
  In this application we can chat with our frinds by choosing same team name. By entering there name and choosing there team. 
  The chat messages also show who and when somebody msg in the team room.
  If the messages overloaded in chat box than it will automatically scroll down to bottom and you can scroll up to see previous messages also.
